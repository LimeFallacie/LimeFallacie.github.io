Portfolio Page for DMC1401IS

#This website is meant to be a mirror of my resume

##Site skeleton: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ozz4zlVkbTWSF4X6L-dgo-fr_kqbj_zyiHMeS7vzRX0/edit?usp=sharing

##Sections:
The site is broken down into several sections;

Skills

Experience

Projects

Interests

Gallery

Contact

##Intention:
My intention was to try something different in html/css for each section:

progress-bar for skills

cards & card-deck for experience

inline images with text for projects

icons and formatting in interests

a carousell for gallery

entry fields for contact
