# This website is meant to be a mirror of my resume

## Site skeleton: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ozz4zlVkbTWSF4X6L-dgo-fr_kqbj_zyiHMeS7vzRX0/edit?usp=sharing

## Sections:
The site is broken down into several sections;

1. Skills
2. Experience
3. Projects
4. Interests
5. Gallery
6. Contact

## Intention:
My intention was to try something different in html/css for each section:

* progress-bar for skills
* cards & card-deck for experience
* inline images with text for projects
* icons and formatting in interests
* a carousell for gallery
* entry fields for contact

## Challenges faced:
Learning the basics of html itself was quite daunting, as I was comparing my work to professional sites that I was familiar with. It was quite a hurdle to brush off the idea that my work was not good enough and to focus on learning.

There were times where the formatting of certain sections did not work as intended, like the card-deck I wanted to use in the Work Experience section, and the Carousel in the Gallery section. A lot of trial and error was used to ensure the site displayed properly.
