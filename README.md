# LimeFallacie.github.io
Portfolio Page for DMC1401IS

# This website is meant to be a mirror of my resume

## Site skeleton: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ozz4zlVkbTWSF4X6L-dgo-fr_kqbj_zyiHMeS7vzRX0/edit?usp=sharing

## Sections:
The site is broken down into several sections;

1. Skills
2. Experience
3. Projects
4. Interests
5. Gallery
6. Contact

## Intention:
My intention was to try something different in html/css for each section:

* progress-bar for skills
* cards & card-deck for experience
* inline images with text for projects
* icons and formatting in interests
* a carousell for gallery
* entry fields for contact

## Challenges faced:
